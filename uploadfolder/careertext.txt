Hi Suraj, 

Thank you for submitting your milestone task for Milestone 4: Create Your Professional Materials II. Your resume looks great so far, and with a few minor changes will be considered Employer Ready. Great work on the organization and information you provided. Not only is your resume neat, it presents you as a Web Developer. Great job! 

You have included several pieces that align with the resume criteria located here http://bit.ly/2op8S5e (provided in the guidelines) including:  

**Heading includes all the first-order information the employer needs**
**Career Summary presents you as a developer, not as a student**
**Highlights skills and projects completed.** - Don’t forget to include additional projects and skills you learn in this section as you continue throughout the program. 
**Education listed in reverse chronological order, with locations & certification received.** - You can remove some of the additional information you listed in the education section in favor of making sure the resume fits cleanly onto one page 
**Clean & Simple Design** - While your original format was clean and well-organized, it hindered getting all the necessary information onto one page. So, I reworked it and removed the lines (light gray and dark gray) in order to get the information onto one page without disrupting your current organization. 
**Consistent and Professional Text**
**Correct Grammar, Spelling & Punctuation**
**Easy to read and professional sounding tone**

In order for your resume to be Employer Ready, please make changes so that it meets the following criteria. 

**Experience clearly laid out, with accomplishments highlighted - not job duties. **
- Ensure experience is listed with job title
- Start every bullet with an action verb; do not use the same verb more than once
- Quantify your work to cite accomplishments (do not list job duties). By restructuring to accomplishment statements rather than listing job duties, the reader can get a better grasp of your skills and be impressed by all the cool things you did at your previous experiences. Remember - accomplishment statements don’t only have to be awards or achievements. Even “providing excellent customer service”, or “providing quality feedback to implement more efficient systems” are examples of achievement statements. 

Good luck with the revisions! If you have any questions, please reply to this comment, email me at dburrage@trilogyed.com or schedule a one-on-one with me at calendly.com/dburrage. 

Thanks!
