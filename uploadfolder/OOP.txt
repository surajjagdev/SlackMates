C#
OOP

--Object is a thing with properties
--Object is synomous with class in microsoft . net and visual studio
--properties of Objects are data.
--Methods are actions that can affect that data
--Objects have or implement encapsulation, polymorphisms, or inheritance

Encapsulations
___________________
-ensure object groups have neccessary properties and methods
-objects can contain other objects.eg Customer can contain an address Object w/ street
towen and postcode properties.

Inhertiance
--Objects can extend other objects
--Person Object may define common properties and methods.
--a Customer may inherit that Person Object and add new properties and methods

--Resultant Objects contains all properties and methods of both the base and new object.

Polymorphism

--2 Objects have same properties and methods but implement them differently.
--use interfaces to define properties and methods--the signature.
--Any object that implement the interface can freely be swapped in and out without breaking code

Example why use Objects
--Commerce site
--Product information, Customer information, Basket, Order.
